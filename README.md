**This is the class for our paper "TAERT: Triple-Attentional Explainable Recommendation with Temporal Convolutional Network".**

## TAERT
Our code is built on top of the official implementations of NARRE (https://github.com/chenchongthu/NARRE). Please use the following code to create a TAERT model in NARRE/model/train.py.

   ```python
   from TAERT import TAERT
   model = TAERT(**args)
   ```
